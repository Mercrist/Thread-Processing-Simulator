     * and exits. Based on the user inputs, it sets the amount of threads and the termination limit:
     * the amount of iterations over the circular linked list. Else, the simulator assigns default values
     * to these variables.

     * If phase '2' is selected, a {@code ThreadRunnable} object containing a
     * circular linked list is created with a default value of twelve nodes. Each thread in the
     * {@code Threads} array list then starts and the main process begins to change tasks from
     * unprocessed to processed. If phase '1' was selected, the circular linked list object is never initialized,
     * and thus never runs, exiting the main loop immediately after creating the threads.
