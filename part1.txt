In the terminal, the program initializes the amount of threads the user passes as input to the command line. The
program declares it's starting up, and prints out a confirmation that each thread is being created. If no input is
passed for the amount of threads, it defaults to creating five threads. Once each thread is initialized, the program
confirms it's done and begins running the threads. Since the threads are in an Array List, it displays the threads
according to their index, in some random order. Since we aren't iterating over the Circular Linked List, any value
passed as the termination limit (number of iterations the program will perform over the CLL), won't have an effect on
the output or the actual program. Simply put, the program initializes the threads and runs each thread once.
